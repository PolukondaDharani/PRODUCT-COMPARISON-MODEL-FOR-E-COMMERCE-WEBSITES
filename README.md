<h1>PRODUCT COMPARISON MODEL FOR E-COMMERCE WEBSITES</h1>

Our project addresses the challenge of simplifying online shopping by developing a website that enables users to compare products from various websites. Instead of visiting multiple sites and sifting through numerous reviews, our platform gathers essential information for you. It displays prices, ratings, and recent counts of positive and negative reviews for each product. Additionally, it offers multilingual support to cater to a diverse range of users.
